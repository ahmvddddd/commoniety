# Community Wallet

A rules-based group wallet system that allows communities, alumni groups, and associations to collect funds, track contributions, and approve withdrawals transparently.

---

## Overview

**Community Wallet** combines the simplicity of a digital wallet with the connectivity of a social network.  
Users can create **virtual accounts** for purposes such as:
- Crowdfunding campaigns  
- Alumni dues and reunions  
- Community projects or charity drives  

Contributors can fund these virtual accounts easily while staying updated on progress, transactions, and goals — creating **trust and transparency** within every community.

## MVP Scope (Phase 1)

The first version of Community Wallet will focus only on three core user flows:

1️⃣ **Create Group & Invite Members**  
- Roles: Owner, Treasurer, Member  
- Set group rules (default templates only)

2️⃣ **Contribute to Group Wallet**  
- Each group gets a virtual account (mock/sandbox for MVP)  
- Members can make deposits  
- Balance updates in real time

3️⃣ **Withdrawal with Approval**  
- Treasurer or Owner requests withdrawal  
- Officers (not all members) approve  
- Payout triggered after required approvals  
- Notifications for each step
