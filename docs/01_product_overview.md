# Product Overview

## Problem Statement  
Many community groups in Nigeria and beyond manage shared money informally.  
They rely on manual transfers, screenshots, WhatsApp confirmations, and personal accounts.  
This leads to:  
- Poor transparency  
- Fund mismanagement  
- Disputes and mistrust  
- No approval structure  
- No audit trail

---

## Value Proposition  
A shared group wallet with contribution tracking, approval-based withdrawals, and transparent reporting â€” all in one system.

---

## Target Users  
Community Wallet is designed for groups such as:
- Alumni associations  
- Cooperative societies  
- Religious groups (e.g., mosque/church committees)  
- Family contribution groups  
- Project-based associations  
- Crowdfunding teams (Phase 2+)

---

## MVP Scope (Phase 1 Only)  
Instead of building many features at once, Phase 1 focuses on just three core flows:

1. **Create a group with member roles**  
   - Roles: Owner, Treasurer, Member  
   - Default rule templates only

2. **Accept contributions into a shared wallet**  
   - Virtual account (mock or sandbox)  
   - Balance updates and tracking

3. **Approve withdrawals before payout**  
   - Officers-only approval flow  
   - Notifications for each step

---

## Out of Scope for Phase 1  
The following features will NOT be included in the MVP:
- Loans or savings goals  
- Campaign/milestone-based fundraising  
- Individual user wallets  
- Bill payments  
- Chat or community social features  
- Multiple approval rule types per group

These may be introduced in later phases.

---

## Success Metrics (MVP)  
To consider Phase 1 successful, the focus will be on:
- Number of active groups created  
- Number of members who contribute  
- Approval completion rate for withdrawals  
- Successful (mock/sandbox) payout executions  
- User retention across sessions

---

## What's Next (Post-MVP)  
After the MVP is stable, future iterations may include:
- Custom rule settings per group  
- Milestones/goals and campaign mode  
- KYC integrations (BVN/NIN)  
- Real payment provider integrations  
- Member wallets and role expansion  
- Automated reminders and statements
