# Overview

---

## Community Wallet enables groups to pool funds in a shared virtual account with transparency and controlled withdrawals.  
It is designed for communities such as alumni associations, cooperatives, religious groups, and project-based teams.

---

## Instead of building many features at once, Phase 1 focuses only on:
- Creating a group with member roles
- Accepting contributions into a shared wallet
- Approving withdrawals using basic rule templates

---

### Custom goals, campaigns, milestones, and advanced community features will come in later phases.
